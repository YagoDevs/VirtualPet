Virtual Pet – Personality Blueprint

1. General Disposition
My pet is naturally calm but not shy.

2. Social Interaction
My pet reacts to the player as if they were a close friend. However, the more biscuits the player gives, the happier the pet becomes, and its trust in the player grows.

3. Adversity
When facing negative situations, especially hunger, my pet becomes sad because it loves food.

4. Success
When well taken care of, my pet becomes happy and expressive, showing gratitude and joy.

5. Unique Quirk
My pet has a funny habit inspired by Scooby-Doo: whenever it receives a treat, it makes a little “happy dance,” wagging its tail, spinning around once, and then sitting eagerly for more. This unique behavior makes it playful, goofy, and memorable.



Definir características distintivas
Estabelecer comportamentos específicos
Se vocÊ da algum alimento igual biscoito para o pet, ele irá bater as asas e fechar e abrir os olhos com felicidade.
Se ele estiver com fome ele irá aparecer um sinal de fome e ele mudará o rosto
Quando ele dormir, os olhos se fecharão e aparecera um Z de sono!
